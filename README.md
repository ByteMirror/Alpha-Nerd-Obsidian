 Custom Obsidian Configuration with Object Oriented Note Taking Approach

## What is Object-Oriented Note-Taking?
Object-Oriented Note-Taking is a methodology that borrows concepts from object-oriented programming and applies them to the organization and management of notes. In this approach, each note (or "object") represents a distinct entity or concept, complete with attributes and relations to other notes.

### Key Principles
Objects as Fundamental Units: Each note is treated as an "object" with specific characteristics and a defined purpose. For instance, a note could represent a person, an event, a place, or an idea.
Attributes: Objects have attributes (properties or fields), such as a person's birthday, an event's date, or a project's deadline.
Relationships: Objects can be linked to show relationships, like a person associated with an event or a task linked to a project.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
This config has lots of keyboard shortcuts defined already. 
My shortcuts might not make sense to you. I encourage you to go through the Hotkey Settings and adjust them to your preferences.
These are the most important shortcuts that you need to operate the system:

- **Creating a Note:** Command + N on Mac. 
- **Deleting a Note:** Command + D on Mac. 
- **Zen Mode:** Command + "."
- **Left Sidebar:** Command + Shift + "A"
- **Right Sidebar: ** Command + Shift + "R"

### For Windows/Linux Users:
Obsidian allows customization of keyboard shortcuts. Windows or Linux users may find some default shortcuts different or may prefer to set up their own for efficiency. You can modify these in the Obsidian settings under 'Hotkeys'.
